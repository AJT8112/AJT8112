- 👋 Hi, I’m @AJT8112
- 👀 I’m building my Software Development skills and would love to learn as much as I can from the coding community.
- 🌱 I’m currently getting a solid understanding of the basics focussing on HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript using FreeCodeCamp.org, Pluralsight and a [RE]Boot Course supported by Leed Trinity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other trainees or people to help with optomising development.
